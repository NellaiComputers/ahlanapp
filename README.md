This is the syllabus and course material for
[CodeYourFuture](https://codeyourfuture.io/) (CYF),
a not-for-profit volunteer-run coding school for refugees, asylum seekers and disadvantaged groups.

During the course you will learn a technology stack that helps you build
anything from a simple website to a powerful database-driven web application!

The eight-month course contains:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Back-end development using [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org)
- Front-end development using [React](https://reactjs.org/)

We'll complement the course with workshops on modern software methodologies
and job interview practices.
